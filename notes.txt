Candidate modules:

1. Numpy, obviously for crunching numbers
2. Pyfolio for backtesting, portfolio development
3. pandas_datareader.nasdaq_trader or yahoo finance API for raw data

Objectives:

First, get basic command line screener running.
    a. Input symbol and receive relevant appraisal stats
    b. Two algorithms:
        i. Jimmy's Discounted cash flow appraisal
        ii. Carlson's Value appraisal

Next step, periodic queries of stock market as a whole searching for good candidates with those algorithms.

UPDATE 12/8/22
I discussed the idea of an automated screener grabbing metrics on every stock with a market cap over some threshold,
idk like maybe like $1B, with Dave, and he recommended a good API:
https://pypi.org/project/finpie/
So I'm going to try importing that. Done.

Next is trying to collect more data. Done.

Current leave off: finpie API may have inconsistencies in data, when trying to use nasdaq_tickers() to use the Fundamentals
lookups, the more obscure tickers will cause exceptions, "no data!" etc. Need to catch and discard these exceptions safely.
Update: exceptions are caught but I think macrotrends is throttling me and throwing one of the errors I am catching
